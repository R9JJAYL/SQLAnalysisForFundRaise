# SQLAnalysisForFundRaise

[To see the analysis click here](https://github.com/R9JJAYL/SQLAnalysisForFundRaise/blob/main/FundRaiseAnalysisReport.pdf)

This is a short analysis to help prepare for a round of fund raising with some key metrics how the business has progressed over the years covering various analysis of the business online performance, such as click through rates, conversion rates, website traffic source analysis and more.

Having used this dataset previously for other analysis, I had familarised myself with times/events such as when website changes and product changes had been made, so when reading the data and making suggestions, sometimes these events are referenced.

Overall I aimed to produce, clear, readable and well commented queries. Showcasing a range and understanding of SQL skills/functions such as: COUNTS, CASE PIVOTS, Subqueries, Temoporary Tables, JOINs, data trends and more. All whilst maintaining and sharing a clear picture of what story the data is showing, so the C-suite can use it for their presentation to the potential investors.

FundRaiseAnalysisCode.SQL is the file with the code & FundRaiseAnalysisReport has the code along with the queries output
